2. Measure profitability, customer acquisition costs, and conversion rates to identify areas for optimization.

 Recommendations  

1. Optimize Google Ads for Conversions  
- Google Ads generates the highest user acquisition (40K users) but has the lowest conversion rate (58%). Consider:  
  - Enhancing ad targeting to reach users more likely to convert.  
  - Improving landing page design for better engagement.  
  - Running A/B tests on ad copy to identify high-performing variants.  

2. Increase Budget Allocation for Meta Ads 
- Meta Ads show the highest conversion rate (93%) with significant profitability. Increasing investment could drive higher overall ROI.  
  - Expand campaign reach by targeting new customer segments.  
  - Leverage lookalike audiences for scaling.  

3. Scale YouTube Campaign Strategically  
- YouTube Campaign has a high conversion rate (93%) but a relatively small user base (0.5K users). Recommendations:  
  - Develop video content aligned with audience preferences.  
  - Use YouTube's in-depth analytics to refine audience targeting.  
  - Experiment with short-form video ads to improve engagement rates.  

4. Monitor and Reduce Acquisition Costs
- The customer acquisition cost (CAC) is consistent across all channels (~₦250). However:  
  - Focus on Google Ads to reduce unnecessary costs while maintaining user acquisition.  
  - Analyze underperforming campaigns or placements to reallocate spending.  

5. Conduct Profitability Reviews by Channel 
- Regularly analyze profit per user and profit margins by acquisition channel.  
  - Channels with declining profitability should be flagged for adjustments in targeting, creatives, or budgets.  

6. Implement Predictive Analytics
- Incorporate machine learning models in the next phase to predict:  
  - Customer lifetime value (CLV).  
  - Future conversion rates by channel.  
  - Optimal budget allocation for maximized profitability. 

 Features of the Dashboard  

- Interactive Filters: Allows users to view metrics by region, product category, and card type.  
- Comparison Panels: Visual comparisons for acquisition costs, total profit, and user conversion rates by channel.  
- Profitability Insights: Identifies the most profitable campaigns at both user and revenue levels.  


 Tools & Skills Utilized  
- Power BI for data modeling, DAX calculations, and visual storytelling.  
- Data Preparation: Cleaned and structured raw data for effective insights.  
- Dashboard Design: Used storytelling techniques to ensure stakeholder engagement.

Learnings & Next Steps  
This project helped me:  
- Improve my Power BI proficiency, focusing on interactivity and dynamic visuals.  
- Enhance my ability to extract and present **key marketing insights**.  

Next Steps:  
- Introduce predictive analyticS for campaign optimization.
